Me and my family went on a holiday there during the summer of 2020. Covid had just taken over our lives but restrictions were lifted and we were able to step away from our house that we’d been trapped in for so long. It was so amazing to be somewhere different, somewhere so mesmerizing. It was nature that really produced my love for the place. We stayed on a farm where we were surrounded by nothing but land, and the friendliest animals - that adored all the attention we were giving them. ",
